                <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Black women physicians' stories have gone untold for far too long, leaving gaping holes in American <br>
                medical history, in women's history, and in black history. It's time to set the record straigt.</span> <br>
                No real account of black women physicians in the US exists, and what little <br>
                mention is made of these women in existing histories is often insubstantial or <br>
                altogether incorrect. In this work or extensive research, Jasmine Brown offers a <br>
                rich new perspective, penning the long-erased stories of nine pioneering black <br>
                women physicians beginning in 1860, when a black woman first entered <br>
                medical school. Browwn champions these black women physicians, including <br>
                stories of: <br>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">Dr. Rebecca Lee Crumpler,</span> who graduated from medical school only fourteen <br>
                months after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed and provided medical <br>
                care for the newly freed slaves who had been neglected and exploited <br>
                by the medical system and many more.
